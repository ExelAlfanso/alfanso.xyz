# Feature Architecture

## Folder Structure

Use `src/features` for product sections or user-facing capabilities. Keep shared primitives outside features.

```text
src/
  components/          # shared UI primitives and app chrome
  constants/           # shared animation constants and helpers
  hooks/               # reusable hooks across features
  features/
    hero/
      components/
      data/
      types/
    about/
      components/
    experience/
      components/
      data/
      types/
    projects/
      components/
      data/
      types/
    tech-stack/
      components/
      data/
      types/
    contact/
      components/
```

Rules:

- Put code in a feature only when it belongs to that feature alone.
- Keep reusable primitives in `src/components`, reusable hooks in `src/hooks`, and shared animation helpers in `src/constants`.
- Add `hooks/`, `data/`, or `types/` inside a feature only when that feature actually needs them.
- Avoid barrel files. Import the exact file you need.

## Best Practices

### Naming

- Use kebab-case for file and folder names: `project-card.tsx`, `use-scroll-spy.tsx`.
- Use PascalCase for React component names and type names.
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and local helpers.
- Keep data files singular by domain: `project-data.ts`, `timeline-data.ts`.
- Prefer `ProjectItem` over `ProjectItems` for one item type.

### Composition

Based on `.agents/skills/vercel-composition-patterns`:

- Start with plain composition and `children`; do not add context/providers until state must be shared across sibling or distant components.
- Avoid boolean prop growth. If a component gets mode flags like `isCompact`, `isModal`, `isFeatured`, create explicit composed variants instead.
- Keep state at the smallest parent that needs it. For example, project modal state belongs to the experience/projects boundary, not global app state.
- Use compound components only for genuinely complex reusable widgets.

### WCAG And UI

Based on `.agents/skills/wcag-audit-patterns` and Vercel Web Interface Guidelines:

- Use semantic HTML before ARIA: `button` for actions, `a` or router links for navigation, real headings for section titles.
- Every interactive element needs visible `focus-visible` styling.
- Modal/dialog behavior must include Escape close, focus containment, and focus return.
- Images need `alt`, `width`, and `height`; decorative images use `alt=""`.
- Do not hide important content behind hover only.
- Check contrast, keyboard operation, heading order, reflow at mobile widths, and reduced motion behavior before shipping.

### Animation And Motion

- Prefer `motion/react` for React UI animation. Avoid mixing `framer-motion` imports with `motion/react` in new code.
- Animate `transform` and `opacity`; avoid layout-heavy animations.
- Keep hooks at the top level. If each mapped item needs motion hooks, extract a child component.
- Use `MotionValue` for scroll-driven values and pass values down instead of recalculating in children.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for decorative or looping effects.
- Use GSAP only for timeline/text effects that `motion` does not handle cleanly.
- Use React Three Fiber/Three.js only for real 3D scenes; keep 3D feature components inside the owning feature.

### Quality Gates

- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` before shipping.
- Use Ultracite for formatting/fix hooks. Lefthook should run Ultracite, not a separate formatter stack.
- Current hook pattern:

```yaml
pre-commit:
  jobs:
    - run: npx ultracite fix
      stage_fixed: true
```

## Library Choices For Future Features

Use what is already installed first:

- UI and composition: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
- Routing: `react-router-dom`.
- Icons: `lucide-react`.
- UI motion: `motion` via `motion/react`.
- Advanced text/timeline animation: GSAP, only when `motion` is not enough.
- 3D: `three`, `@react-three/fiber`, `@react-three/drei`.
- Formatting and static checks: Ultracite/Biome, ESLint React Hooks.
- Git hooks: Lefthook running Ultracite.

Add new libraries only when the feature earns them:

- Forms: native forms first; add React Hook Form plus Zod when validation/state gets complex.
- Server state: fetch first; add TanStack Query when caching, retries, invalidation, or background refresh matter.
- Client state: React state first; add Zustand only for cross-feature client state.
- Accessible primitives: native HTML first; add Radix UI for complex dialogs, menus, popovers, tabs, or comboboxes.
- Tables: plain tables first; add TanStack Table for sorting/filtering/column state.
- Accessibility testing: add axe/Playwright integration when UI flows become testable end to end.
